SCRUM GUIDE - SCRUM FRAMEWORK

=== SCRUM DEFINITION ===

Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

Scrum is:
- Lightweight
- Simple to understand
- Difficult to master
- Based on empiricism and lean thinking
- Employs iterative, incremental approach

Empiricism: Knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed.

Lean Thinking: Reduce waste and focus on the essentials.

=== SCRUM THEORY ===

Three Pillars of Empiricism:

1. Transparency
- Work must be visible to those performing it and those receiving it
- Decisions based on perceived state of artifacts
- Low transparency can lead to wasteful decisions

2. Inspection
- Scrum artifacts and progress must be inspected frequently
- Detect undesirable variances
- Inspection enables adaptation

3. Adaptation
- Adjust process or product if inspection reveals issues
- Adapt as soon as possible to minimize further deviation

=== SCRUM VALUES ===

Five Scrum Values:

1. Commitment
- Commit to achieving team goals
- Commit to supporting each other

2. Focus
- Focus on sprint work
- Focus on moving toward goals

3. Openness
- Open about work and challenges
- Transparency in communication

4. Respect
- Respect each other as capable, independent people
- Respect different perspectives

5. Courage
- Courage to do the right thing
- Courage to work on tough problems
- Courage to make decisions

=== SCRUM TEAM ===

The Scrum Team consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers.

Scrum Team Characteristics:
- Cross-functional: Skills necessary to create value each Sprint
- Self-managing: Internally decide who does what, when, and how
- Small enough to remain nimble (typically 10 or fewer people)
- No sub-teams or hierarchies
- Accountable for creating valuable Increment every Sprint

Product Owner:

Responsibilities:
- Maximizing value of product
- Managing product backlog:
  * Developing and communicating Product Goal
  * Creating and communicating Product Backlog items
  * Ordering Product Backlog items
  * Ensuring Product Backlog is transparent and understood

Authority:
- One person, not a committee
- May delegate work but remains accountable
- Decisions must be respected by organization
- Can cancel Sprint if Sprint Goal becomes obsolete

Scrum Master:

Responsibilities:
- Accountable for Scrum Team's effectiveness
- Enabling team to improve practices within Scrum framework
- True leader who serves the Scrum Team and larger organization

Serves Product Owner:
- Help find techniques for Product Goal definition
- Help team understand need for clear Product Backlog items
- Help establish empirical product planning
- Facilitate stakeholder collaboration

Serves Developers:
- Coach in self-management and cross-functionality
- Help team focus on high-value Increments
- Remove impediments to progress
- Ensure Scrum events are productive and kept within timebox

Serves Organization:
- Lead and coach in Scrum adoption
- Plan and advise Scrum implementations
- Help employees understand empirical approach
- Remove barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams

Developers:

Responsibilities:
- Create plan for Sprint (Sprint Backlog)
- Instill quality by adhering to Definition of Done
- Adapt plan each day toward Sprint Goal
- Hold each other accountable as professionals

Typical size: 3-9 people

=== SCRUM EVENTS ===

Sprint:

- Fixed-length event (one month or less)
- Container for all other events
- New Sprint starts immediately after conclusion of previous Sprint
- All work happens within Sprints
- No changes made that endanger Sprint Goal
- Quality does not decrease
- Product Backlog refined as needed
- Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with Product Owner

Sprint Planning:

Purpose: Lay out work for the Sprint
Timebox: Maximum 8 hours for one-month Sprint (shorter for shorter Sprints)
Attendees: Entire Scrum Team

Topics Addressed:
1. Why is this Sprint valuable? (Sprint Goal)
2. What can be Done this Sprint? (Select from Product Backlog)
3. How will chosen work get done? (Create plan in Sprint Backlog)

Output: Sprint Backlog (Sprint Goal + selected items + plan for delivering them)

Daily Scrum:

Purpose: Inspect progress toward Sprint Goal and adapt Sprint Backlog
Timebox: 15 minutes
Frequency: Every working day of Sprint
Attendees: Developers (Product Owner and Scrum Master participate if working on Sprint Backlog items)

Benefits:
- Improve communications
- Identify impediments
- Promote quick decision-making
- Eliminate need for other meetings

Sprint Review:

Purpose: Inspect Sprint outcome and determine future adaptations
Timebox: Maximum 4 hours for one-month Sprint
Attendees: Scrum Team and key stakeholders
Format: Working session, not presentation

Activities:
- Present completed work
- Discuss what went well, problems encountered, how problems solved
- Demonstrate work and answer questions
- Review what has changed in environment
- Collaborate on what to do next
- Review timeline, budget, capabilities for next anticipated product release

Output: Revised Product Backlog

Sprint Retrospective:

Purpose: Plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness
Timebox: Maximum 3 hours for one-month Sprint
Attendees: Scrum Team
When: After Sprint Review, before next Sprint Planning

Topics:
- What went well during Sprint?
- What problems did we encounter?
- How were (or weren't) problems solved?
- What will we commit to improve in next Sprint?

Output: Identified improvements to implement in next Sprint

=== SCRUM ARTIFACTS ===

Product Backlog:

- Emergent, ordered list of what's needed to improve product
- Single source of work for Scrum Team
- Items that can be Done within one Sprint are ready for selection in Sprint Planning
- Refined through backlog refinement (decompose and further define items)
- Commitment: Product Goal (future state of product)

Product Backlog Item Attributes:
- Description
- Order
- Estimate
- Value

Sprint Backlog:

- Composed of Sprint Goal, selected Product Backlog items, and plan for delivering them
- Highly visible, real-time picture of work Developers plan to accomplish during Sprint
- Updated throughout Sprint as more is learned
- Commitment: Sprint Goal

Sprint Goal:
- Single objective for Sprint
- Creates coherence and focus
- Created during Sprint Planning
- Added to Sprint Backlog
- Provides flexibility regarding exact work needed to achieve it

Increment:

- Concrete stepping stone toward Product Goal
- Each Increment additive to all prior Increments
- Multiple Increments may be created within Sprint
- Sum of Increments presented at Sprint Review
- Work cannot be considered part of Increment unless it meets Definition of Done
- Commitment: Definition of Done

Definition of Done:
- Formal description of state of Increment when it meets quality measures
- Moment Product Backlog item meets Definition of Done, an Increment is born
- Creates transparency by providing everyone shared understanding of what work was completed
- If item does not meet Definition of Done, it cannot be released or presented at Sprint Review

=== SCRUM AT SCALE ===

Scaling Scrum for Multiple Teams:

Nexus Framework:
- Extends Scrum to guide multiple teams working on single product
- Adds Nexus Integration Team
- Adds Nexus events that augment Sprint events
- Maintains accountability and transparency

Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS):
- Scales Scrum by trying to stay within Scrum rules
- One Product Owner for all teams
- One Product Backlog for all teams
- One potentially shippable product Increment

Scrum of Scrums:
- Coordination mechanism for multiple Scrum teams
- Representatives from each team meet regularly
- Discuss dependencies, integration issues, and cross-team impediments

=== COMMON SCRUM ANTI-PATTERNS ===

Sprint Planning Anti-Patterns:
- Product Owner not available or prepared
- Team overcommits habitually
- Not creating Sprint Goal
- Sprint Planning takes entire day

Daily Scrum Anti-Patterns:
- Becomes status report to Scrum Master or Product Owner
- Exceeds timebox regularly
- Problem-solving during Daily Scrum
- Team members absent frequently

Sprint Review Anti-Patterns:
- Becomes formal presentation with slides
- No stakeholder attendance
- Demo of incomplete work
- No discussion of what to do next

Sprint Retrospective Anti-Patterns:
- Skipped when "nothing went wrong"
- Same issues raised repeatedly with no action
- No psychological safety to raise issues
- Scrum Master dominates conversation
