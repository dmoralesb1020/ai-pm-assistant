PMBOK GUIDE - PROJECT MANAGEMENT FUNDAMENTALS

=== PROJECT MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW ===

Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements. A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.

Key characteristics of projects:
- Temporary in nature with a defined beginning and end
- Create unique deliverables
- Progressively elaborated as more information becomes available
- Require resources that are often from various areas

=== PROJECT LIFE CYCLE AND PHASES ===

Projects typically progress through five process groups:

1. Initiating Process Group
- Defines and authorizes the project or phase
- Develops project charter
- Identifies stakeholders
- Establishes initial scope

2. Planning Process Group
- Establishes scope, refines objectives, and develops course of action
- Creates project management plan
- Defines and sequences activities
- Estimates resources and durations
- Develops schedule and budget
- Plans quality, communications, risk, and procurement

3. Executing Process Group
- Completes work defined in project management plan
- Directs and manages project work
- Manages stakeholder engagement
- Performs quality assurance
- Acquires and develops project team

4. Monitoring and Controlling Process Group
- Tracks, reviews, and regulates project progress and performance
- Monitors and controls project work
- Performs integrated change control
- Validates and controls scope
- Controls schedule, costs, quality, and risks

5. Closing Process Group
- Finalizes all activities to formally close the project or phase
- Closes project or phase
- Obtains final acceptance of deliverables
- Documents lessons learned

=== WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE (WBS) ===

The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables.

WBS Best Practices:
- Decompose work into manageable components
- Each level represents increasingly detailed definitions of project work
- Lowest level is called work package
- Use 100% rule: WBS includes 100% of work defined by project scope
- Deliverable-oriented grouping works best
- Typically 3-4 levels deep for most projects

=== PROJECT CHARTER ===

The project charter is a document issued by the project initiator or sponsor that formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.

Key components:
- Project purpose or justification
- Measurable project objectives and success criteria
- High-level requirements
- High-level project description and boundaries
- Overall project risk
- Summary milestone schedule
- Pre-approved financial resources
- Key stakeholder list
- Project approval requirements
- Assigned project manager and authority level
- Name and authority of sponsor or other person authorizing the project charter

=== RISK MANAGEMENT ===

Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives.

Risk Management Process:
1. Identify Risks - Determine which risks may affect the project
2. Analyze Risks Qualitatively - Prioritize risks by probability and impact
3. Analyze Risks Quantitatively - Numerically analyze the effect of identified risks
4. Plan Risk Responses - Develop options and actions to enhance opportunities and reduce threats
5. Monitor Risks - Track identified risks, monitor residual risks, identify new risks

Risk Response Strategies:
- For Threats: Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate, Accept
- For Opportunities: Exploit, Share, Enhance, Accept

=== STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT ===

Stakeholders are individuals, groups, or organizations who may affect, be affected by, or perceive themselves to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project.

Stakeholder Management includes:
- Identifying all stakeholders
- Analyzing stakeholder expectations and impact
- Developing strategies to engage stakeholders
- Managing stakeholder engagement throughout project lifecycle
- Monitoring overall stakeholder relationships

Stakeholder Analysis considers:
- Interest in the project
- Influence over the project
- Level of involvement needed
- Potential impact on project success

=== CHANGE MANAGEMENT ===

Change control is the process of identifying, documenting, approving or rejecting, and controlling changes to project baselines.

Integrated Change Control Process:
1. Change Request Submission
2. Change Request Review
3. Change Impact Analysis
4. Change Approval/Rejection
5. Change Implementation
6. Change Verification
7. Update Project Documents

All change requests should be:
- Documented in writing
- Reviewed by change control board
- Assessed for impact on scope, schedule, cost, quality, and risk
- Approved before implementation
- Tracked and communicated to stakeholders
