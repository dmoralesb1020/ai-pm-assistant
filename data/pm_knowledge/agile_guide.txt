AGILE PRACTICE GUIDE - AGILE METHODOLOGIES

=== AGILE MINDSET AND VALUES ===

The Agile Manifesto values:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

While there is value in the items on the right, Agile values the items on the left more.

Agile Principles:
1. Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
3. Deliver working software frequently, with preference to shorter timescale
4. Business people and developers must work together daily
5. Build projects around motivated individuals and trust them
6. Face-to-face conversation is most efficient method of conveying information
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity - the art of maximizing work not done - is essential
11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12. Team reflects on how to become more effective and adjusts accordingly

=== AGILE FRAMEWORKS AND APPROACHES ===

Common Agile Frameworks:

1. Scrum
- Most widely used Agile framework
- Works in time-boxed iterations called Sprints
- Defined roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
- Ceremonies: Sprint Planning, Daily Standup, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective

2. Kanban
- Visualize workflow
- Limit work in progress (WIP)
- Manage flow
- Make process policies explicit
- Implement feedback loops
- Improve collaboratively

3. Extreme Programming (XP)
- Pair programming
- Test-driven development
- Continuous integration
- Refactoring
- Simple design

4. Lean
- Eliminate waste
- Build quality in
- Create knowledge
- Defer commitment
- Deliver fast
- Respect people
- Optimize the whole

=== AGILE PLANNING ===

Agile Planning Levels:

1. Product Vision and Roadmap
- Long-term strategic direction
- High-level features and capabilities
- Release planning with target dates

2. Release Planning
- Features and stories for upcoming releases
- Typically 3-6 month timeframe
- Prioritized product backlog

3. Iteration/Sprint Planning
- Detailed planning for upcoming iteration
- Task breakdown and estimation
- Commitment to iteration goals

4. Daily Planning
- Daily standup meetings
- Task assignments and adjustments
- Immediate impediment removal

=== USER STORIES ===

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability.

User Story Format:
"As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [benefit/value]"

Example:
"As a project manager, I want to generate status reports automatically so that I can save 2 hours per week"

INVEST Criteria for Good User Stories:
- Independent: Can be developed in any order
- Negotiable: Details can be discussed
- Valuable: Delivers value to users
- Estimable: Can estimate effort required
- Small: Can be completed in one iteration
- Testable: Clear acceptance criteria

Acceptance Criteria:
- Specific conditions that must be met for story to be considered complete
- Written in Given-When-Then format
- Example: "Given I am logged in, When I click 'Generate Report', Then a PDF report is created"

=== ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES ===

1. Story Points
- Relative sizing technique
- Based on complexity, effort, and uncertainty
- Common scales: Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
- Not tied to hours or days

2. Planning Poker
- Team-based estimation technique
- Each member estimates independently
- Discuss differences and converge on estimate
- Promotes team discussion and shared understanding

3. T-Shirt Sizing
- High-level estimation (XS, S, M, L, XL)
- Quick and simple
- Good for initial backlog grooming

=== SPRINT/ITERATION EXECUTION ===

Typical Sprint Flow (2-week example):

Day 1: Sprint Planning
- Review and refine user stories
- Team commits to sprint goal
- Break stories into tasks
- Estimate tasks

Days 2-9: Development
- Daily standup (15 minutes)
  * What did I do yesterday?
  * What will I do today?
  * Any impediments?
- Continuous development and testing
- Update task board daily

Day 10: Sprint Review/Demo
- Demonstrate completed work to stakeholders
- Gather feedback
- Update product backlog based on feedback

Day 10: Sprint Retrospective
- What went well?
- What didn't go well?
- What should we improve?
- Create action items for next sprint

=== AGILE METRICS ===

Key Metrics:

1. Velocity
- Amount of work completed per iteration
- Measured in story points
- Used for forecasting future capacity
- Track as rolling average over 3-5 sprints

2. Burndown Chart
- Visual representation of work remaining
- Updated daily
- Shows if team is on track to complete sprint

3. Cumulative Flow Diagram
- Shows work in different states over time
- Identifies bottlenecks
- Visualizes WIP

4. Cycle Time
- Time from work starting to completion
- Helps identify process inefficiencies
- Lower is generally better

5. Lead Time
- Time from request to delivery
- Customer-facing metric
- Includes wait time before work starts

=== DEFINITION OF DONE (DOD) ===

Definition of Done is a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete.

Typical DoD Checklist:
- Code written and peer reviewed
- Unit tests written and passing
- Integration tests passing
- Documentation updated
- Acceptance criteria met
- Product Owner approved
- Deployed to staging environment
- No critical bugs

Benefits:
- Ensures quality
- Creates transparency
- Prevents incomplete work from accumulating
- Establishes team accountability

=== AGILE ANTI-PATTERNS ===

Common mistakes to avoid:

1. Agile in Name Only
- Following Agile ceremonies without embracing values
- No real empowerment or collaboration

2. No Product Owner Engagement
- Product Owner unavailable or not engaged
- Lack of clear priorities
- Team makes product decisions without guidance

3. Skipping Retrospectives
- Missing opportunities for continuous improvement
- Repeating same mistakes

4. Overcommitting
- Taking on more work than capacity allows
- Leads to incomplete sprints and technical debt

5. No Definition of Done
- Unclear completion criteria
- Accumulating technical debt
- Quality issues

6. Ignoring Technical Debt
- Focus only on new features
- Quality degrades over time
- Velocity decreases

=== TRANSITIONING TO AGILE ===

Steps for Successful Transition:

1. Assess Current State
- Document current processes
- Identify pain points
- Understand organizational culture

2. Build Agile Knowledge
- Training for all team members
- Understand Agile values and principles
- Learn specific framework (Scrum, Kanban, etc.)

3. Start Small
- Pilot with one team
- Learn and adapt
- Demonstrate value

4. Create Supporting Environment
- Remove impediments
- Provide necessary tools
- Foster collaborative culture

5. Scale Gradually
- Expand to more teams
- Maintain consistency
- Continue learning and adapting
